# Msim
A toolbox of objects to create simple scenes
and simulate several sensors (cameras and Laser Rangefinder Scanners).

This toolbox provides several classes
to create mathematical scenes
formed by simple elements:
- Planar polygons

These scenes can then be observed by different sensors
- Laser Rangefinder scanner (LRF)
- Multiple LRF
to generate simulated measurements
and use them to evaluate different algorithms
with the available groundtruth.
